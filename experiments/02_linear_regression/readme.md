# Linear regression experiment

This experiment builds a base for the linear regression power prediction model.

The LR model predict the power of window in which each core is either fully occupied by some workload, or is not occupied at all. Thus, such sample windows are created, the power consumption is measured, and the respective coefficients of the LR are identified.

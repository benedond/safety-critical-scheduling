# Thermal evaluation

In this experiment, a set of instances is generated, and the solvers are executed providing us with the `optimized' schedules. The schedules are then executed on a real platform; the steady-state temperatures are then compared.

**TODO: now the Autobench benchmarks are generated such that they end after some iteration (there is no TB_OPTS="--count=0"). Fix is needed."**

 # BAP vs ILP-global (preliminart dataset)
 
 Compare performance of BAP algorithm with ILP-global model.
 So far, it is the first (non-optimized) implementation of BAB with branching on job pairs.
 Comparison will be done on smaller instances with 5, 10, 15 tasks.
 
 - `GEN.sh` generate instances
 - `RUN.sh` run the solvers
 - `STAT.sh` report statistics
 - `CHECK.sh` check if the solutions of BAP and GLOBAL solver are the same

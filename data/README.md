# Example data

 - <b>environment.json:</b> environment data that can be used with instance generator.
 - <b>assignment_input.json:</b> input for phase 1 solver that has a feasible solution both in phase 1 and 2.
 - <b>assignment_input_p2_infeasible.json:</b> input for phase 1 solver that has a feasible solution in phase 1, but no feasible solution in phase 2.
 - <b>assignment_input_suboptimal.json:</b> input for phase 1 solver that has a feasible solution in phase 2, which requires suboptimal resouce assignment in phase 1.
 - <b>instance.json:</b> input for phase 2 solver that has a feasible solution.
 - <b>solution.json:</b> optimal solution for *instance.json*.
